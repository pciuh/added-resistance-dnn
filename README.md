# Added Resistance DNN Regression 
# **Neural Network Model Documentation**

This repository contains a **feedforward neural network** implemented using Keras. 
The model is designed for **regression tasks**, incorporating **regularization** and **dropout** to prevent overfitting. Description and justification of approach is presented in a [*Jupyter-Notebook*](https://github.com/pciuh/added-resistance-dnn/blob/master/DNN_training.ipynb)
