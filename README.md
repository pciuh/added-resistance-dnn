# Added Resistance DNN Regression 

This repository contains a **feedforward neural network** implemented using Keras. 
The model is designed for **regression tasks**, incorporating **regularization** and **dropout** to prevent overfitting. Description and justification of approach is presented in a *Jupyter-Notebook* [`DNN_training`](https://github.com/pciuh/added-resistance-dnn/blob/master/DNN_training.ipynb) 

Further the built model can be used to predict added resistance for selected features trained in previous step. The example of prediction is presented in a *Jupyter-Notebook* [`pred_dnn`](https://github.com/pciuh/added-resistance-dnn/blob/master/pred_dnn.ipynb)
